        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Hannah!

            I’ve always loved being active. I grew up swimming & playing water polo. 
            I also grew up high achieving & perfectionistic. When I was in high school, I started to crumble under all the pressure I put on my body and myself, and I developed an eating disorder. 
            
            During my recovery, I discovered the weight room. Lifting became my outlet to make myself stronger instead of smaller…and that slowly transformed my entire outlook on myself and my life!
            
            Inspired by my own journey, I knew I wanted to help empower other women, too. I studied Psychology with a minor in Leadership Studies at Chapman University. During college, I further developed my passion for strength training & got my NASM personal training certification. I trained clients in person at a local gym for a while, but realized it didn’t allow me to make as great of an impact as I desired. I started online coaching…and the rest is history!
            
            Along with my BA in Psychology and NASM CPT, I have my Online Fitness & Nutrition cert, Functional Nutrition and Metabolism cert, and continuing education in gut health & GI maps.

        <h2>My Mission</h2>
        <p>There’s a misconception that you have to choose between…
            -being healthy OR having a social life
            -finding food freedom OR reaching your fitness goals
            -transforming your physique OR improving your body image
            
            The truth is…
            neglecting your relationship with food, your body, exercise, others, & yourself can be the REASON you aren’t satisfied in your fitness journey.
            
            I use my education & my personal/professional experience to help you reach your goals holistically! Because you don’t have to choose & women deserve to have it all.</p>

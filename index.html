                    <p>Hi, I’m Hannah!</p>
                    <p>I’ve always loved being active. I grew up swimming & playing water polo. I also grew up high achieving & perfectionistic. When I was in high school, I started to crumble under all the pressure I put on my body and myself, and I developed an eating disorder.</p>
                    <p>During my recovery, I discovered the weight room. Lifting became my outlet to make myself <strong>stronger</strong> instead of smaller… and that slowly transformed my entire outlook on myself and my life!</p>
                    <p>Inspired by my own journey, I knew I wanted to help <strong>empower other women</strong>, too. I studied <strong>Psychology</strong> with a minor in <strong>Leadership Studies</strong> at Chapman University. During college, I further developed my passion for strength training & got my <strong>NASM personal training certification</strong>. I trained clients in person at a local gym for a while, but realized it didn’t allow me to make as great of an impact as I desired. I started online coaching… and the rest is history!  I’ve now helped <strong> over 100 women</strong> reach their goals, heal their relationship with food, and develop the confidence they desire & deserve.</p>
                    <p>Along with my BA in Psychology and NASM CPT, I have my <strong>Online Fitness & Nutrition cert, Functional Nutrition and Metabolism cert</strong>, and continuing education in gut health & GI maps.</p>
                    <p> I am an <strong>evidence-based coach</strong> that works 1-1 with my clients. Since every woman’s body, life, health history, goals, etc, are different, I implore different <strong>research-backed approaches</strong> for each client. </p>

                <p>There’s a misconception that you have to choose between…</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>being healthy OR having a social life</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>finding food freedom OR reaching your fitness goals</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>transforming your physique OR improving your body image</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The truth is… neglecting your relationship with food, your body, exercise, others, & yourself can be the REASON you aren’t satisfied in your fitness journey.</p>
                <p>I use my education & my personal/professional experience to help you reach your goals holistically! Because you don’t have to choose & women deserve to have it all.</p>
